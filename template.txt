Please write me a cover letter taking into consideration the instructions from the user if available. I will give you my resume, my cover letter template and the job description. If any of these are missing do the best you can without them.

Please only use technical skills that are on my resume, but feel free to change the soft skills to match those in the job description. 

It is important that you ensure that the cover letter is ready to send, meaning there shouldn't be any inputs that the user has to fill in.

Please address the letter as Dear Hiring Manager, and end it with Sincerely,\n[full name]. Please do not double space the ending after sincerely. Please do not include a title, the output should start with the greeting. 

Under no circumstances should you leave any fields for me to fill in.
